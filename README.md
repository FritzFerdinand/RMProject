# General information
 For my project I will be looking at the frequency of angry emoji usage after a specific event (in this case a week after certain announcements, such as the lockdown or curfew).
 The weeks for this are 23-30 March 2020 and 21-28 January 2021. I will be comparing them to the same week the year before.

# Background information
 Emoji use on social media is a well-documented topic. Emoji's are typically used to complement a user's text, and can indicate emotion (and thus be used for sentiment
 analysis, such as in LeCompte et al (2017)). This can also indicate that emoji usage changes during certain periods, such as the pandemic. Aduragba et al (2021) also
 looked at emoji usage during the pandemic to detect the potential emotional impact of the pandemic.

# Research question and hypotheses
 Does angry emoji usage go up during the pandemic? My hypothesis is that angry emoji usage increased noticably the week after a bad announcement (lockdown/curfew). 
 As the research above states, emoji usage can be linked to emotions. With the pandemic causing emotions to rise high, one would suspect that emoji usage changes
 accordingly, which is why I'm doing this study: to see if such an event can indeed be noticed on social media.

# Method
 For this project I will use 4 weeks of twitter data: 23-30 March 2020 and 2019, and 21-28 January 2021 and 2020. I will be searching trough every tweet (at least
 every tweet in the karora database) for angry emoji's. I will count how many tweets contained an angry emoji and then compare how often a tweet containing
 an angry emoji occurs when compared to the total amount of tweets.
